# Accelerating discovery in Natural History through modern computation

## Outline

- Collections are incredibly valuable (time, money, risk)
  - To gather insights from our collections require a large amount of
    additional effort
    - These tasks are typically labor intensive, e.g., taking
      measurements of each gathered species.  Some of our collections
      are now so big, that the task is impossible; i.e., we are
      forfeiting on scientific discovery.
- Question: can we utilize modern technology to improve our ability to
  access, analyze, and interpret all this data?
- Steps:
  1. Get the data into a form the computer can analyze
  2. Perform automated extraction of features required for analysis
  3. Verify and correct the extracted features
  4. Perform analysis, as one would before
- Innovations we are going to be talking about are centered around
  (2), using image analysis, and to some degree (1), using scanning
  and photography.

Could have some discussion about the meta-process here.

We want to mention something about the title: how we can accelerate NH
through computation.

- I will now walk you through three example projects that I've been
  involved in:

  - Shark fin analysis
    - Perhaps talk about permutation testing
  - Inselect
  - Insect wings
  - Butterfly analysis

- Future challenges: ALICE

### Shark fin analysis

- This was back in South Africa.
- Researcher came with database of photographs in a very intricately
  named directory structure.
